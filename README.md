## Introduction
I built this clipboard feature as part of my efforts to learn web development, specifically focusing on using the Clipboard API to manage copied content and improving my skills in React hooks and CSS animations.

To implement the clipboard feature, I used several different technologies and techniques, including the useState and useRef hooks for managing state and handling user interactions, as well as timer functions to control the behavior of the clipboard feature. I also used try-catch statements to handle errors that may arise when working with the Clipboard API.

In addition to the technical aspects of the project, I also paid close attention to the user experience of the clipboard feature, using conditional rendering and CSS animations to create an intuitive and engaging interface that makes it easy to copy and manage text snippets.

Through building this clipboard feature, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of web development concepts and technologies, while also creating a practical tool that can be used by myself and others to improve productivity and streamline workflows.
